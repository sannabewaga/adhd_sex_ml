<h2>Welcome to the ADHD & Sex Prediction Project</h2>
<p>
This project explores behavioral data to build predictive models for two outcomes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>ADHD Diagnosis Prediction</strong> using Logistic Regression</li>
    <li><strong>Sex Classification</strong> using Logistic Regression</li>
</ul>

<p>
Due to the high dimensionality of the data (20,000+ features), user input is not collected.
Instead, we present a summary of model performance, insights from the data, and ethical considerations.
