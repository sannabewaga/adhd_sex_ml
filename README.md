# ADHD & Sex Prediction Using Logistic Regression

## üìå Overview

This project explores the application of **logistic regression** on high-dimensional behavioral data to predict two targets:

* **ADHD Diagnosis** (Binary Classification)
* **Sex Classification** (Binary Classification)

Due to the input feature size exceeding 20,000 dimensions, a traditional user-input interface was not feasible. Instead, this Flask web app showcases model performance and insights based on trained data.

## üìä Dataset

* **Samples**: 243 test samples (after split)
* **Features**: 20,000+ behavioral/psychological inputs
* **Targets**:

  * `ADHD` ‚ûî 0 = No ADHD, 1 = ADHD
  * `Sex` ‚ûî Binary (0/1)

---

## üß™ Methodology

* **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression (for both models)
* **Preprocessing**: Vectorization, scaling, and train-test split
* **Evaluation Metrics**:

  * Accuracy
  * Precision
  * Recall
  * F1-Score
  * Confusion Matrix

## üõçÔ∏è App Design (Flask)

* App does not accept user input
* Pages:

  * `Home`
  * `Model Performance`
  * `Insights`
  * `Limitations`
* All visualizations and metrics shown statically

---

## üîç Insights

* **ADHD Model**:

  * High recall for ADHD cases
  * Many false positives for non-ADHD
  * Useful as a screening tool, not for diagnosis

* **Sex Model**:

  * Higher accuracy for majority class
  * Lower performance for minority class
  * May reflect behavioral patterns

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

* Very high feature dimensionality
* Models trained and validated only on internal dataset
* ADHD model underperforms on negative class
* No generalizability to clinical usage
* Potential ethical implications in usage
